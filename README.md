# Apriori-Algorithm
> This is a very basic implementation of the Apriori Algirithm.<br/>
> In the following implementation the input to be provided are <br/>
> `No. of transactions: ` **An integer** <br/>
> `t{i}` _i representing the transaction id_ **Elements/Items of the transaction seperated by space** <br/>
> `Support Count:` **An integer** </br>

> The output of the code will be the table elements of the **Largest Itemset** Table that we get on solving the algorithm mathematically.
